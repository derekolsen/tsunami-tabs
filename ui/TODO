  - May need to combine chord lines and lyric lines so they wrap together.
    This might require a function that differentiates lyrics from symbols/notes that intersperse with chords
    The function would probably need to automatically group lines
      - Cases:
          1. 1 line of chords and 1 line of lyrics
          2. Arbitrary number of lines of chords
          3. ?
  - Function to detect actual tablature and wrap properly.
      - This would require line groups of several lines (most likely just support 4 and 6 for guitar, bass, and uke)
  - Consider a mobile-only linebreak indicator
